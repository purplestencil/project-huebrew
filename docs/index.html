	<h1>Project Documentation</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>This project is being developed as a final project for COS-796, toward the completion of a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science. The aim of this project is to demonstrate skills that have been learned over the course of this degree as well as to demonstrate
		a capacity for independent learning and technologies not covered in the course curriculum. I will be teaching myself JSON and JavaScript, and using the publicly available Phillips hue API to create a web application that can perform a basic light control
		function for a Phillips hue light. I will also be using tools and techniques that have been taught in Software Engineering (source control) and Management Information Technology (project management) to work on and manage this project.
	</p>
	<h3>Project Goals</h3>
	<p>This project will allow me to learn and demonstrate the following skills:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write the project scope (requirements document) before the start of project work</li>
		<li>Use Git for source control and repo management</li>
		<li>Learn JSON syntax and data types</li>
		<li>Learn to write JSON data (simple and complex) on my own</li>
		<li>Learn how to use JSON with JavaScript and HTML</li>
		<li>Learn to collect the required piece of information even from complex JSON data</li>
		<li>Learn how to contact an API and collect JSON response</li>
		<li>Develop a basic web application making use of a publicly available API (Phillips hue API)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>High-Level Requirements</h3> 
	<p>This application will provide a web interface to perform the basic light control functions that are currently available in the native Phillips mobile apps. </p>
	<p>The application will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the web UI. The application will provide the following hue controls:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Connect to a Phillips hue bridge</li>
		<li>Add a hue light to the application</li>
		<li>Turn a light on and off</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Deliverables</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Web application</li>
		<li>Source code</li>
		<li>Project documentation</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Tools Used</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Git (source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/purplestencil/project-huebrew">GitHub</a>)
		</li>
		<li>Notepad++
		</li>
